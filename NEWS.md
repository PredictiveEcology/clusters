# clusters 0.0.23

## New features

* Core reservations. `plan_psock_min()` sized every cluster from
  `parallelly::freeCores()`, which reads a *trailing* load average (5 minutes by
  default). Two clusters built inside that window both saw the same idle cores
  and both claimed them, because the load created by the first had not yet
  reached the average the second read. Callers worked around it by staggering
  builds by more than the averaging window and hand-tuning the number of
  concurrent jobs against the size of the fleet.
  A small file-backed ledger now records what each build actually took
  (`reserveCores()`), and allocation subtracts live reservations from the
  measured free cores (`freeCoresLessReserved()`). Reservations are keyed by id,
  so one process may hold several clusters and release them independently; they
  are released when the cluster object is collected or R exits, and any entry
  whose owning process is gone is dropped on the next read, so a killed master
  cannot leak one. Disable with `options(clusters.useReservations = FALSE)`;
  point concurrent masters on different machines at one shared file with
  `options(clusters.reservationsPath = )`.

* `verifyClusterHosts()` checks, before the real cluster is built, that every
  host can actually run a worker: matching R major.minor, matching versions of
  the packages the worker must load, matching GDAL, and -- the one that
  previously surfaced only as a worker dying mid-run -- that those packages
  *load* rather than merely being present. Missing system libraries
  (`libtbb.so.12` for RcppParallel, a mismatched `libgdal.so.NN` for sf/terra)
  are caught here. All offending hosts are reported at once. Set
  `options(clusters.onBadHost = "drop")` to continue without them instead of
  erroring.

## Bug fixes

* The GDAL parity check in `plan_psock_min()` could never fire. It read
  `stopifnot(length(unique(sf::sf_extSoftVersion()["GDAL"], GDALversions)) == 1)`
  -- `unique()`'s second argument is `incomparables`, not a second vector to
  compare against, so this asked whether a length-1 vector has one unique value.
  Always true. Replaced by a real cross-host comparison in
  `verifyClusterHosts()`.

* `plan_psock_min()` no longer syncs the project library with `rsync --update`.
  That flag skips files that are *newer on the receiver*, so a downgrade on the
  master never propagated and a stale-but-newer copy on a worker won -- version
  drift by construction, on exactly the packages the run depends on. The master
  is now authoritative (`--delete` within the synced package directories), and a
  failed rsync raises rather than being ignored.
