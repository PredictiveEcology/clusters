\title{Estimate the number of active threads currently being used}
\usage{
numActiveThreads(pattern = "", minCPU = 50)
}
\arguments{
\item{pattern}{An optional search pattern to look for when identifying threads
that are active. If left at default, then all threads that are active will count.}

\item{minCPU}{The minimum CPU (in percent , i.e.,0 to 100) that a thread must
be using for it to count as actively being used.}
}
\value{
An integer representing the current number of threads that are being used
as a CPU\% greater than \code{minCPU}. This can be used, e.g., with
\code{parallelly::availableCores()} to estimate the number of cores that are available
to be used.
}
\description{
This only works on non-linux operating systems, as it uses \code{ps}
}
\note{
This does not address memory or disk use issues.
