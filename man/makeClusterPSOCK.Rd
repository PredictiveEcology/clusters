\usage{
makeClusterPSOCK(
  workers,
  outfile = NULL,
  rscript_libs = NULL,
  ...,
  port = NULL,
  rshopts = c("-o", "ExitOnForwardFailure=yes"),
  tries = 5L,
  delay = 5,
  renice = 20,
  revtunnel = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{workers}{The hostnames of workers (as a character vector) or the
number of localhost workers (as a positive integer).}

\item{outfile}{Optional log file path.}

\item{rscript_libs}{Optional library paths for workers.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to parallelly::makeClusterPSOCK.}

\item{port}{Optional port or port block start.}

\item{tries, delay}{Maximum number of attempts done to launch each node
with \code{makeNode()} and the delay (in seconds) in-between attempts.
If argument \code{port} specifies more than one port, e.g. \code{port = "random"}
then a random port will be drawn and validated at most \code{tries} times.
Arguments \code{tries} and \code{delay} are used only when
\code{setup_strategy == "sequential"}.}

\item{renice}{A numerical 'niceness' (priority) to set for the worker
processes.}

\item{revtunnel}{If TRUE, a reverse SSH tunnel is set up for each worker such
that the worker \R process sets up a socket connection to its local port
\code{(port + rank - 1)} which then reaches the master on port \code{port}.
If FALSE, then the worker will try to connect directly to port \code{port} on
\code{master}.
If NA, then TRUE or FALSE is inferred from inspection of \code{rshcmd[1]}.
For more details, see below.}
